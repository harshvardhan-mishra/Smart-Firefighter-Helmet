# Smart-Firefighter-Helmet
A smart firefighter helmet equipped with microprocessors and sensors to provide a better guide system for firefighters
Fire-fighting has been a problem since the medieval ages. Even with the advent of
modern technology, we havenâ€™t been able to reduce fire accidents significantly. Our
proposed project aims to use all relevant data, to remedy any fire accident. The
project uses a variety of sensors and the collected data is processed and utilized to
alert authorities and display meaningful results. All our sensors are integrated with
one central microcontroller. The microcontroller is responsible for relaying the data to
a shared database, from where the processed data is retrieved. Location data is
broadcasted from the server to all clients in the nearby area.
The main idea of this project is to monitor the physical parameters around the
fire-fighter in hazardous situations, the whole project is supposed to be mounted on
the helmet of the individual. The parameters needed to be monitored are
temperature, humidity, air condition i.e. levels of toxic and inflammable gases in the
atmosphere nearby including the atmospheric pressure of the area.
